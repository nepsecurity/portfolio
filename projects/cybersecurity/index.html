      <h2>Introduction to Red Teaming</h2>
      <p>
        Red teaming is a form of ethical hacking that simulates real-world cyber attacks to test and improve an organization's security posture.
        This involves identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and providing recommendations to enhance security.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website provides hands-on red teaming projects to help you develop and refine your skills in ethical hacking and cybersecurity.
        Each project is designed to simulate real-world scenarios and build your expertise in red teaming.
